        <div class="steps">
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove skin from the rotisserie chicken and discard. Pull chicken off the bones and discard the carcass. Roughly chop chicken meat into bite sized cubes. You should have about 4 to 6 cups. Set this aside.</li>
                <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the chicken stock and dissolve the bouillon cubes in the stock. In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter then add the onions and saute them over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the flour to the onions and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the hot chicken stock into the sauce. Simmer over low heat for 1 more minute, stirring, until thick. Add heavy cream, sugar, onion powder, pepper, rosemary and coriander. Add the cubed chicken and mixed veggies. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken mixture from heat and allow to slightly cool. Preheat oven to 450 F. Spray two 12-cup muffins tins thoroughly with cooking spray. Roll out 1 pie crust at a time on a floured, smooth surface.</li>
                <li>Using a 4 1/2 inch round cookie cutter (or perhaps a small bowl), cut out 24 shapes for the bottom crust, rolling out additional crusts as needed. Line the crusts in the bottoms of the muffin tins, making sure that the edges come out over the tops of the tins.</li>
                <li>Spoon cooled chicken mixture into crust lined tins, about 2 heaping tablespoons per pie. Use a 4-inch round to cut out shapes for the top crusts, rolling out additional crusts as needed. Place top crusts over the tops of the tins, crimping the bottom crust edges together with the top ones to seal the pies. Spray pie tops with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Bake pies for about 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before removing from muffin tins (they will be very hot).</li>
